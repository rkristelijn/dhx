# DHX v6.x

This code is downloaded from the [dhx](dhtmlx.com) website and I stored in my github for reference and ease of access. The code can be downloaded in zip format and is hard to quickly look at.

@see [here](https://forum.dhtmlx.com/t/simple-example-for-e-g-layout/68125/2) for discussion.

For the official full suite, see [github.com/DHTMLX/dhtmlx-suite.gpl](https://github.com/DHTMLX/dhtmlx-suite-gpl)
